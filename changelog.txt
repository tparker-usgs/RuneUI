•	Hostname changes work on the fly, all dependant variables modified, and dependant jobs restarted.
•	Fixed some issues with Spotify, however Spotify no longer works due to changes made by Spotify in May 2018. Settings UI text included to explain this.

Default settings are based on the Pi type on initial start-up. Automatic output device configuration based on MPD settings. Artist-info, lyrics and screen-saver now work in the same way for MPD and Airplay. SoXr for Airplay is included but disabled.

•	Added workaround fixes for situations when shairport-sync and the RuneAudio player fail to broadcast their respective names on the network (using avahi). The problem tends to happen only after 24+ hours of usage, the reason is unknown.

Known problems:

•	Special characters in the WiFi SysID will fail.
•	Casting MP3 via UPnP/DLNA has sound quality problems, other file formats are OK. See here for the probable cause: http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/digital-output-and-input-for-runeaudio-t6592.html
